"""Wiring tests for the "Dispatch to agent-marketplace" / "Fetch changelog
for dispatch" steps in `release.yml` and `dispatch.yml`.

Ticket #44 moved the actual payload-building logic (previously two
near-identical `python3 - <<'PY' ... PY` heredocs) into a single shared
script, `.github/scripts/marketplace-payload.sh`, invoked by both workflows.
That script's own behaviour (envelope shape, byte-exact changelog round-trip,
truncation, key omission, warnings) is covered against the *real* script in
`tests/test_release_scripts.py` (R3/R4/R3b) -- there is no heredoc left here
to `exec()` in-process, so this file is reduced to wiring/text-layer checks
only: what each step's `run:` text and `env:` mapping actually say, parsed
straight out of the YAML (mirroring `tests/test_release_workflow.py`'s
`_load_workflow`/`_find_step` pattern), plus unit tests of the
continuation-folding helpers `_direct_redirect_lines` relies on.

Every wiring test that has a counterpart in both workflows is parametrized
over `workflow` in `{release.yml, dispatch.yml}`.

    `start_index` is the FIRST physical line, `end_index` the LAST
    (identical for a line that folded with nothing). `_direct_redirect_lines`
    checks `end_index` to see whether, by the time the physical line
    carrying the actual redirect text was reached, an unclosed
    `$(...)`/backtick wrapper was already open -- information the folded
    text alone can't carry, since folding only merges backslash-
    continuations and a wrapper's opening character need not be
    backslash-continued into the line(s) it wraps. `end_index` (not
    `start_index`) is the one that matters: a wrapper opener can itself
    begin on the fold's own first physical line (e.g. split across a
    continuation boundary) and only become "unclosed as of" a later
    physical line within the very same fold -- checking `start_index` alone
    would miss that, since by definition nothing precedes a fold's own
    first line.

    Continuation semantics (shell-accurate): a physical line is folded into
    the next one only when its LITERAL LAST CHARACTER (before the line
    ending) is `\\` -- a backslash followed by trailing whitespace is NOT a
    continuation in real bash, and is therefore NOT folded here either.
    Chains of 3+ physical lines fold into a single logical line.

    Whitespace: the following line's content is preserved as-is, including
    its own leading indentation -- joining does NOT strip the continuation
    line's indentation before appending it (a deliberate, documented choice).

    Terminal-backslash contract: if the LAST physical line ends in a
    trailing backslash with nothing left to fold into, the backslash is
    stripped and the line is still emitted, unfolded -- no exception, no
    dropped line, no dangling `\\` in the returned string.

    A SINGLE pass over the FULL `run_text` string (round 2 fix) -- not
    `run_text.splitlines()` scanned line-by-line in isolation -- tracking
    `$(`/`)` paren-depth, backtick parity, single-/double-quote state and
    `#`-comment state together, character by character, so state carries
    correctly across physical-line boundaries. This structurally closes two
    round-2 review findings at once:

    - A wrapper opener whose two characters (`$` and `(`) land on different
      physical lines -- e.g. because a backslash-continuation sits between
      them -- is still recognized as one atomic opener, the same way real
      bash splices a `\\\\\n` away before tokenizing (this is the mirror
      image of `_join_continuation_lines`'s already-established
      continuation folding: there the split was in the INVOCATION, here it
      is in the WRAPPER's own opening token). A per-physical-line scan
      bounded by each line's own length can never see this, since the
      second character never appears within the first line's own index
      range.
    - `$(`/backtick appearing inside a `'single-quoted'` string, or after an
      unescaped `#` comment marker, has NO special meaning and does not
      affect the tracked depth/parity -- matching real bash. A `$(`/backtick
      inside a `"double-quoted"` string RETAINS its special meaning (bash
      still performs command substitution inside double quotes), so
      double-quoted regions are scanned for `$(`/`)`/backtick exactly like
      bare, unquoted text; only `"` itself behaves differently there (it
      CLOSES the region instead of opening one, and `#` does not start a
      comment). A backslash (outside single quotes, including inside double
      quotes) escapes the next character for exactly one character, EXCEPT
      when that next character is a newline -- that's a shell
      line-continuation instead: no state toggle of its own, but the
      newline is still a real physical-line boundary (`run_text.splitlines()`
      still treats it as a new physical line), so it still gets its own
      `open_before` entry.

    Deliberately unhandled, documented simplifications (not needed for
    these workflows' simple `run:` blocks): here-docs (`<<`), ANSI-C
    quoting (`$'...'`), a `\\\n` continuation occurring *inside* a
    single-quoted string (real bash: not a continuation there, still two
    literal characters -- this scanner does not special-case that
    pathological overlap), and other exotic shell lexing. Comment state is
    reset at every `\n` crossed -- continuation or plain -- a simpler,
    deliberately chosen behaviour rather than modelling comment survival
    across a spliced line.
